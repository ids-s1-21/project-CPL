# Brief introduction to our data set

Variables:

- name: Athlete Name

- age: Athlete Age
- height: Athlete Height in cm
- team: Country/Team competing for
- games: Olympic games name
- year: Year of olympics
- sport: Sport
- medal: Medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze or NA)

# The spike at age 46

## Another spike at age 52

</small>
```{r medals-by-sports-52, echo=FALSE}

  filter(age >= 50, age <= 54 ) %>%

## The top 3 sports the older athelets are good at

```{r top-3, echo=FALSE}

    x = "Height",
    y = "Probability of winning a medal"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
<small>NB: We specified the range in height between 150 and 185 so that we can get a linear  relationship.</small>

## The modelling table 
```{r modelling_table,echo=FALSE}
linear_reg()%>%
  set_engine("lm")%>%
  fit(probability_medal ~ height, data = olympics_model_medal) %>%
  tidy()
```
*The possibility of winning a medal regarding the height is: 
*$$Probability=0.000128Height-0.0184$$

# Conclusion
<small>
So, are younger athletes more likely to have a better performance than older athletes?
YES.Remind that:
</small>
```{r probability-vs-age1, out.width="70%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
population_by_age <- olympics %>%
  count(age)

medal_by_age <- olympics %>%
  na.omit(medal) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  mutate(n_medal = medal %in% c("Bronze", "Silver", "Gold")) %>%
  count(n_medal) %>%
  select(age, n) 

possibility_by_age <- medal_by_age %>%
  left_join(population_by_age, by = "age") %>%
  mutate(possibility = n.x/n.y)

possibility_by_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = possibility)) +
